Hi all,
Here is a detail post about _Bendy Bones_, a new feature of version [version 2.78][1]. _Bendy Bones_ are a better version of BBones, with more parameters.

Before explaining features in a video, here are some written notes:  

* Control lots of paramters direcly in UI, instead of indirectly set intermediate bones.

* All this parameters can be animated, and can be accessed by a new _Keying Set_ for adding _Keyframes_ more easilly.

![][3]

* Bendy Bones curvature can be edited on _Edit mode_ for setting a rest pose curve.

![][4]

* Reference bones can be used instead of parameters. These bones are not only parent/child of _Bendy Bones_, like it was with _BBones_.

![][5]

* When using a constraint where you can set _Head/Tail_, interpolation is now done on curvature, not on linear interpolation between Head and Tail.
