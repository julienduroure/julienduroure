Here is a totally new version of my website.  
This year, I had lots ok hacking problems with my [Wordpress][1] version of my site...  

So I decided to migrate it to [Jekyll][2] : no more hackers, only static content.  
This is now more easy for me to maintain / write new posts.    
Hope you will love it :)  

Not so much more content (for now) that you can find previously on my "old" site:  

*  [Some quick description of my skills (rigging, animation, scripting, training)][3]
*  [A blog with posts about various themes, around 3D and Blender of course][4]
*  Link to my [BleRiFa website][5], that fetchs all my addon development.
*  How to [contact me][6] if you want me to work for you.

# What's new :  

*  New [RSS feed][7], update your links ;-)
*  Subscribe to newsletter (at bottom of this post): Don't miss any news
*  In [blog post list][4], you will now see [BleRiFa][5] news too

Enjoy!
