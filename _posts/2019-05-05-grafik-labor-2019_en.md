Hi all,

May, 11rst and 12nd will be the 2019 edition of [Grafik Labor][1], in Rennes, France. This year, the edition theme is open source 3D and game development.

I will give a talk (in French), about animation data export / import into Blender and Godot. I will also animate a workshop about animation in Blender.

See you soon!
