Hi all,  
[Capitole du Libre, 2017 edition][3] is coming (November 18th & 19th)! This is a big event, in Toulouse, about free & opensource software.  

This year, I will give a speach (in French) about rigging automation in Blender ([Rigify][4], [BlenRig][5] et [AutoRig Pro][6]).  
This talk will take place on room A203, sunday at 11.30AM.

If you are not afraid by french speaking, you will find here the [complete schedule][2] of [this event][3].

Cheers!
