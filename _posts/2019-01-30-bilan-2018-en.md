Hi all,  
It's not too late to wish you an happy 2019!  

Here is a quick review of my 2018:


# End of 2017

![][21]

2017 finished quite well: I gave a Rigging Training, via [Les Gobelins][16], for an animation studio that want switch its pipeline to Blender. This kind of training is always rewarding for me too, because I can have some discussion with other riggers, working on other tools, with other habits, other constraints.

# Toulouse Game Dev

![][22]

I gave a talk about Rigging, during a meeting of [Toulouse Game Dev][6].

# New Job

![][24]

Besides my Frelance activities, I have another job, and I quit my job and start a new one at begining of 2018. I am now a developer / Technical Artist, as subcontractor of [_Airbus Defence & Space_][17].  
All this blog is my own thoughts, and not linked to work I'm doing for my employer for Airbus :)

# glTF importer

![][23]

I developed (first for [_Airbus DS_][17], then for myself) a Blender addon for importing glTF/glb files into Blender.  

I was contacted by [Khronos][18], in order to work on a new importer/exporter addon. Here is the addon [Blender-glTF-IO][1] on which I'm working for a while (on importer part for me).

This addon is now part of Blender 2.80 source code :)

# Dilili à Paris

{% include youtube.html id="1NSMtkfw29k" %}
<br/>  

Last October, 10th was released feature film [Dilili à Pairs][2], of [Michel Ocelot][19].  
I was happy to work on the movie with [Les Fées Spéciales][3], in 2017. I did a horse rig.

# Lodève Museum

![][25]

With [Les Fées Spéciales][3] too, I worked on 2 rigs for some animation of the [museum of Lodève][4].

# Mr TicToc & the endless city

{% include vimeo.html id="264157462" %}
<br/>

The game [_Mr Tic-Toc & the endless city_][13], by studio [_Un je ne sais quoi_][14] was annonced on April. I rigged some characters in 2017.


# Module d'ouverture

![][26]

Since 2010, I teach Blender in [INSA, an engineer school][15].

# BUG Paris

![][27]

I gave a talk, invited by [Blender User Group of Paris][5], about Rigging.

# VSE Book

![][28]

During the summer, I was part of a book sprint about Blender _Video Sequence Editor_. The (french) book is named _Blender pour le montage video_. This was organised by [FLOSS Manual Francophone][12].

# Animation Training

![][29]

I gave (via [Les Fées Spéciales][3]), 2 times 1 week of training about animation on Blender. This was for an animation studio starting a production on Blender.

# Blender Conference

{% include youtube.html id="w97ryTu18TA" %}
<br/>

This year again I was in _Blender Conference_, where I gave a talk with Airbus DS, about [some work I did][8].  
I was also co-speaker for French speaking meeting.


# Another: Suzanne Awards

{% include vimeo.html id="295213472" %}
<br/>

I did 2 rigs for the short [_Another_][9], and this short won [Suzanne Awards 2018][20]!

# Capitole du Libre

{% include youtube.html id="aSQL89V1Zb0" %}

I gave a talk about Rigify (and also a talk with [RGBa][11] about 2.80)

# BleRiFa

Unfortunately, with all the stuff I already spoke, I didn't have so much time to work on [BleRiFa]. Only some updates that you can find directly on [BleRiFa website][10].


# RGBa

![][30]

WIth [RGBa collective], we met during a week-end to continue working together. It was a really pleasant week-end, I hope we will be able to meet again more times this year!



2019 should be a great year too :)
