I wish you an happy new year :)  

![][99]  

This is the occasion to have a little summary of 2015, and have a look to 2016.

In 2015 first, I published some articles that you can read [on this blog][1]. In 2015 I moved to this current website : I hope you like it.

Most important fact in 2015 is creation of [RGBa][2]. With friends from Toulouse, we performed an old wish to work together with creation of [RGBa][2] collective.

Meaning of [RGBa][2] is to work together on more important projects : Animation, interactive applications, VR, etc...

Our first project is an animated short about a baby spider. We are currently on pre-production stage.

I worked on rigging, and tested it by creation of a little workflow test named "The Encounter".

We was happy to be nominated on last [Suzanne Awards][3], in Character Animation category.

2016 will be a great year, with lot of projects (blog posts, rigging, animation, tutorials) that should be ready during the year.

Meanwhile, I wish you an happy new year once again.
