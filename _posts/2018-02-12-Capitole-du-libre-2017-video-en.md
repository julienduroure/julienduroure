Hi all,  
[Capitole du Libre, 2017 edition][3] took place last November 18th & 19th! This was a big event, in Toulouse, about free & opensource software.  

This year, I gave a speach (in French) about rigging automation in Blender ([Rigify][4], [BlenRig][5] et [AutoRig Pro][6]).  

If you are not afraid by french speaking, you can now watch the video on youtube!
