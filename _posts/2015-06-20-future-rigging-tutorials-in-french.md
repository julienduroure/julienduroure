Hi there,
I plan to write/record some tutorials about rigging in French. I currently don't know what will be the used medium (book / video / pdf / html ... ).

In order to know what are needs from people, I wrote a survey that can be found here (in French, of course) :
[Rigging survey][1]

If you are French people and interested in rigging in Blender, don't hesitate to fill it !
