Hi all,
I will give soon a short talk (in french) for [Toulouse Game Dev][1].  
I will talk about rigging in Blender, and some exporters to game engines.  

This talk will be on January, 24th, at [Etincelle Coworking][2]. Registration must be done on [Meetup][3].  
If you speak French, don't hesitate to come and discuss :)
