Hi all,  
It's not too late to wish you an happy 2020!  

Here is a quick review of my 2019, as [I did last year][1].

# Grease Pencil training

At the start of the year, I had the opportunity to follow a _Grease Pencil_ training at [Les Fées Spéciales][2], given by the excellent [Daniel Martinez Lara][3].

# Rigging for 'Criquet de La Crau'

For [Les Fées Spéciales][2] again, I worked on the short film [_Criquet de La Crau_][4], where I rigged the cricket.

# Animation initiation in Blender

I taught rigging and animation initiation in Blender, at the University of Cergy Pontoise, as part of the [license professionnelle Infographie: patrimoine, visualisation et modélisation 3D][5]

# Human and bird rigs

I made, for the studio from Bordeaux [_Un je ne sais quoi_][6], 2 rigs, one for a human character, the other for a bird, all for a game project. Here is a _trailer_:

# GrafikLabor

I talked, as part of [GrafikLabor 2019][6]. This conference dealt with the exchange of animation data between Blender and Godot (notably thanks to the glTF format).

# Airbus

I was lucky to be able to be hired by [Airbus Defense & Space][7], where I had previously been a subcontractor. I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that everything on this site is only mine, and is not related to the activities I do for Airbus :)

# Module d'ouverture

Since 2010, I teach Blender in [INSA, an engineer school][8].

# Blender Conference

This year, I did not give a conference in English during the [Blender Conference][9], but I, as for a few years now, co-hosted the [French-speaking meetings][10].

# Capitole du Libre

I gave a conference during the [Capitole du libre][12] which talked about the glTF format for data exchange between Blender and Godot.

# Rig pour Polycake Collective

I made a rough sketch rig for the collective [_Polycake Collective_][13] (with whom I had already worked last year on the short film _Another_). Due to lack of time (and skill in the face rigging part), I had to stop my work along the way.

# BleRiFa

Like last year, unfortunately, due to lack of time, I didn't work so much on my addons. I have however started, for some of them, the conversion to version 2.80

# glTF

I worked, throughout the year, on the import (then on the import / export) of [glTF 2.0 format][14] in Blender. I talked about it mid-year in [this article][15]. Since then, a lot has been done on export (in particular on the rigging & animation part), to bring it to a suitable level.

# Et ensuite ?

2019 was not an easy year! What does 2020 hold in store for us? Difficult to say at the moment, even if currently, I wish to take a step back, to rest a little bite. The previous years have all been exciting, but I think I also have to think about my health and my family.
