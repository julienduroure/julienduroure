Hi all!

During the summer, I was part of a _book sprint_ about Blender VSE. The (french) book is named _[Blender pour le montage video][1]_.  
There are lots of detail about VSE features, and more, like some technical explanations about encoding, containers ...  

If you speak French, you can read it for free online, or download it as pdf or ePub. A printed version will be available soon.  
This book is published under [GPL][2] et [CC-BY-SA 4.0][3] licenses.  

This is a collective book, written in 5 days, with [FlossManuals FR][4] association. We were 8 writters and 1 facilitator.  It was my first _book sprint_, and I really enjoy it :)
