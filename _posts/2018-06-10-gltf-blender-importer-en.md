Hi all,  

I'm currently implenting a [glTF 2.0 importer for Blender](https://github.com/julienduroure/gltf2-blender-importer) :)  

This developpment is still in progress, and I need your help: Please test it, and report bugs!  
You will find source code, a first release (and more information) on my github: [https://github.com/julienduroure/gltf2-blender-importer](https://github.com/julienduroure/gltf2-blender-importer)

Here are some examplesof glTF2.0 file imported into Blender ([samples](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models)):
