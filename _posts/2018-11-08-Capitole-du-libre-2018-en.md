Hi all,  
[Capitole du Libre, 2018 edition][3] is coming (November 17th & 18th)! This is a big event, in Toulouse, about free & opensource software.  

This year, I will give a speach (in French) about rigging automation in Blender with [Rigify][4].  
This talk will take place on room A203, saterday at 4.30PM.  

I also participate in a talk with my friends of [RGBa collective][1] about future 2.8 version of Blender. (saterday at 11.30AM)

If you are not afraid by french speaking, you will find here the [complete schedule][2] of [this event][3].

Cheers!
