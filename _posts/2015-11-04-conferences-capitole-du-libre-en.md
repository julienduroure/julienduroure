Hi all,
I am happy to tell you that I will give 2 different talks, in French, during "[Capitole du Libre][3]", November, Saturday 21rst.

This conference is organized by "Toulibre" association.

## Rigging for animators

At 11h, I will present how rigging can be very useful for animators.

## Inside a short movie creation

At 5h30 PM, I will by part of this talk by [RGBa][2] team. I will, of course, talk about rigging & animation.

I just realized that I didn't talk here about [RGBa][2] yet. This will be done in next few weeks.

Don't hesitate to come to "Capitole du libre" if you speak French!
